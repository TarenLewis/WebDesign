Repo for HTML/CSS learning

Most of this content is developed through the OneMonth course by Chris Castiglione, for HTML/CSS and also JS.
His website is located @ https://onemonth.com/dashboard 

I recommend his content if you are a student (normally the courses are $200 each but I was able to get one month of courses
free through the Github student developer pack. Great value, since you can go through multiple courses if you are able to
complete them faster than the standard 30 days (courses don't have due dates so you can progress as fast as you want).
